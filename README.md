# Canadian Parliament tracker

__A personal project to scrape and track data from the Canadian Parliament.__

Welcome to the Parliament tracker! This is a personal project I've built to track the Canadian House of Commons. Each night it will scrape members and  bills from Parliament's website and update a database.

The project is in it's infancy. There are a lot of features which do not work at this point and many routes which are dead, but if you're interested in following along or helping out it exists on [GitHub](https://github.com/sdleitch/parliament-tracker). You can also get in touch with me through [email](mailto:s.d.leitch@gmail.com)
